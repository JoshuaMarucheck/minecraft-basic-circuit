I don't remember how A* works, so let's plan it out here.


min-heap or priority queue for current states to explore


there's a heuristic based on where you are (taxicab distance)

a state type
a move type
a cost function of the form state move state -> cost

a backtrack map
length of shortest path to a given state



The algorithm:
repeat until path is found:
 - pick the node with the lowest projected path cost and explore it
