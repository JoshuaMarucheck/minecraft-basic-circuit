Placing points:

graph length:
for x steps
Distance is at max 8x

find min path on the graph to all placed points
find objective max distance function

constraints?
  y in [0,255]
  x > 0 (with certain start and end points at x=0)
  within valid distance of all currently placed points

starting with start and end points placed first at given positions.
and positions are ints
