//  Blocks: Block IDs defining the terrain. 8 bits per block. Sorted by height (bottom to top) then length then width—the index of the block at X,Y,Z is (Y×length + Z)×width + X.
//  AddBlocks: Extra bits that can be used to further define terrain; optional. Two nibbles are put into each index in this array. Unlike normal chunks, even indexes go on the high nibble and odd indexes go on the low nibble.
//  Add deprecated: Old versions of Schematica used this instead of AddBlocks. Byte array where each byte contains additional data to define terrain, in order. This tag should not be written.
//  Data: Block data additionally defining parts of the terrain. Only the lower 4 bits of each byte are used. (Unlike in the chunk format, the block data in the schematic format occupies a full byte per block.)
//  Entities: List of Compound tags.
//  A single entity in the schematic.
//  See the Chunk Format -> Entity Format.
//  TileEntities: List of Compound tags.
//  A single tile entity in the schematic.
//  See Chunk Format -> Block Entity Format.

// SchematicaMapping: ID mapping for the version this schematic was saved in, used by Schematica. Provided only for materials used in the schematic.
// [name]: Indicates that name has the given ID (e.g. [name] being minecraft:stone and the value being 1).
// ExtendedMetadata: Arbitrary additional data, provided by Schematica for extensions. Optional, and is provided only if not empty.
// WEOriginX: WorldEdit-only origin X coordinate; optional but if one is provided all parts should be.
// WEOriginY: WorldEdit-only origin Y coordinate; optional but if one is provided all parts should be.
// WEOriginZ: WorldEdit-only origin Z coordinate; optional but if one is provided all parts should be.
// WEOffsetX: WorldEdit-only offset X coordinate; optional but if one is provided all parts should be.
// WEOffsetY: WorldEdit-only offset Y coordinate; optional but if one is provided all parts should be.
// WEOffsetZ: WorldEdit-only offset Z coordinate; optional but if one is provided all parts should be.
// itemStackVersion: MCEdit2-only; 17 if items use numeric IDs (1.7.x) and 18 if items use text IDs (1.8.x).
// BlockIDs: MCEdit2-only; maps numeric block IDs to textual IDs.
// [number]: The textual ID for the given number (e.g. [number] is 1 and the value is minecraft:stone)
// ItemIDs: MCEdit2-only; maps numeric item IDs to textual IDs. Provided only if itemStackVersion is 17.
// [number]: The textual ID for the given number (e.g. [number] is 1 and the value is minecraft:stone)
// TileTicks: MCEdit-Unified only; list of queued block updates (as in the chunk format)
 i: The ID of the block; used to activate the correct block update procedure.
 p: If multiple tile ticks are scheduled for the same tick, tile ticks with lower p are processed first. If they also have the same p, the order is unknown.
 t: The number of ticks until processing should occur. May be negative when processing is overdue.
 x: X position
 y: Y position
 z: Z position
